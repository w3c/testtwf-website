# How to become a Reviewer

One important step in the test submission process is to review the tests submitted by contributors. The changes being in pull requests makes it very easy for people to review the tests. You can just poke at the code, and if it looks good, press a big green button. That's it.

It's fun. It makes your hair sheen and your fresh bright. And you get to show off at cocktail parties about how you just made a major contribution to building a better web for all of  humankind and its descendants to come.

All of that with just the press of a big and friendly green button! And the perk is a little bit of code reading.

So if you're ready for the undying adoration of wild throngs of web developers, if you've got the unassumingly humble tone of your "I was just doing my job" line, and if you feel a hankering to press glossy green buttons with a motion of such lissome yet muscular grace that bystanders feel like it's happening in slow motion, then waste no time and head straight for it.

You can be a reviewer.
