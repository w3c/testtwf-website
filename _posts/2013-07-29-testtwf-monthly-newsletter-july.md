### Get Involved

#### Host your own Test the Web Forward event!

If you're a community leader, part of a web-related user, or belong to an
organization that wants to make the Web a Better place, consider hosting an
event of your own or partnering with others in your area to put one on. It
may be a small meetup-style event or a full hackathon like the one we just
had in Tokyo. Either way, we can point you in the right direction.  We're
pleased to announce that for smaller events, a new [Meetup Kit][14] is
available.  

For assistance in planning larger events, we'll soon be rolling out a full
Event Kit - stay tuned!  If you're interested in hosting, partnering, or
Sponsoring a future event, let us know at public-testtwf-planning@w3.org.


Let's keep making the Web a Better Place!
