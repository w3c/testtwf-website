We're very excited that Test the Web Forward is coming to the Pacific Northwest!
The event will be held at the Microsoft office in downtown Seattle, graciously
hosted by the Internet Explorer Developer Relations team.  We'll kick things off
Friday evening, April 12, with a series of short talks to get people up to speed
for writing tests the next day.  There will be time after the talks to mingle
with experts from Mozilla, Adobe, and Microsoft, get set up, and come up with a
plan for Saturday hacking.  We'll return on Saturday morning and the test writing
will begin. Food &amp; drinks will be served throughout the event and some excellent
raffle prizes given away at the end.  When it's over, the Open Web community will
be stronger and we'll have moved the web forward just a little more...
