Its been almost one year since Adobe hosted the very first Test the Web Forward event! We'll be celebrating its anniversary in Tokyo later this week, where we'll be joining Google in hosting our sixth event.  In the past year, we've seen the movement grow with incredible enthusiasm and support from all over the world. The excitement is palpable in the Japanese web development community, with event registration filling up in just 12 hours. We have a great series of tech talks given by an impressive lineup of speakers, including an opening message on the importance of web standards given by Shigeo Okamoto of the Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications.  During the hackathon, we have a long list of experts to support new test writers,  including many local developers, spec editors, and W3C members. For the first time at a TestTWF event, the tech talks will be streamed live on June 7 at 7PM JST (11AM GMT) and June 8 at 9AM (12AM GMT).
