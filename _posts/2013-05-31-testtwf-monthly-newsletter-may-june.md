## Welcome to all of our new subscribers

We enjoyed meeting you at the SFHTML5 Meetup and AdobeMAX LA this past
month. Thanks for joining our community as it grows and we continue to
work together to make the Web a better place. We spoke with many of you
interested in hosting your own Test the Web Forward events all around the
world. We had multiple people interested in Brazil, Austin, TX, Tel Aviv,
Ontario, Canada, Los Angeles, CA, and Washington DC. As we mentioned,
we've prepared an event kit to help you plan your own event, so please do
let us know if you'd like to take the next step. Also, if you'd like to
partner with someone in your area, this mailing list would be a good place
to reach out to others possibly in your area.  We look forward to helping
you lead the movement!
