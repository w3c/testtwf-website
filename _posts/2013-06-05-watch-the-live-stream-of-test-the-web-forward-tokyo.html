We're coming upon our sixth Test the Web Forward event happening this Friday in
Tokyo. It's promising to be the best one yet with an impressive lineup of
speakers and experts. Our keynote speaker and special guest is Shigeo Okamoto
from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, who'll be delivering
an opening message about the importance of Web standards in Japan.
