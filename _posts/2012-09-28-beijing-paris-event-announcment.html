Adobe, in partnership with multiple organizations and individuals, is organizing two Test The Web Forward hackathons in Beijing (October 20-21) and Paris (October 26-27). The goal of these events is to bring the web community together to create test cases in order to improve the quality of the web – Like the slogan says “Better tests for a better web!.”

The individual pages for <a href="http://testthewebforward.org/beijing-2012.html">Beijing</a> and <a href="http://testthewebforward.org/paris-2012.html">Paris</a> have more information on the topics that will be covered, experts that will be attending and logistics. You can also follow <a href="http://twitter.com/testthewebfwd">@testthewebfwd</a> on twitter to get the latest information.

We are really excited to join forces with a growing number of organizations like Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Mozilla, Opera, the W3C and others to Move the Web Forward. We hope that you can join us too! The registration is now open for events in <a href="http://testthewebforward_beijing_2012.eventbrite.com/">Beijing</a> and <a href="http://testtwfparis.eventbrite.com/">Paris</a>. See you there!
