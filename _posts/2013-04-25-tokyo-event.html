After a very successful event in Seattle a couple of weeks ago, we're moving
onward to Tokyo. It's already shaping up to be a great event with many working
group members and W3C staff in town for F2F meetings. Plus, we already have many
experts in Japan signed up and they're psyched to help make this another great
one! Space is limited and we expect a full house, so register soon.
