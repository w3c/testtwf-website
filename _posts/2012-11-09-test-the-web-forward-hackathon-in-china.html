<p>W3C China Office and Adobe co-organized the <a href="http://testthewebforward.org/beijing-2012.html">Test The Web Forward event on Oct 20-21, 2012 in Beijing</a>. The intention of this hackathon was to help more Chinese developers to get involved in contributing to the web platform. Three W3C specifications including CSS Flexible Box, CSSOM View, and CSS3 Backgrounds and Borders were targeted during this event. 17 experts from W3C, Adobe, Google, Intel, Mozilla, Opera, UCWeb, Tencent, Baidu, Taobao, Qihoo360, Maxthon, and Huawei were there to help the attendee to get acquainted with how to Read a W3C Spec, how to Write a W3C Reftest and how to File a Good Bug Report. Over 260 developers from about 160 organizations registered for this event. 119 test cases (hard: 1, normal: 9, easy: 109) were submitted and 12 browser bugs were filed as the results of the test hackathon. Positive feedbacks have been gained from local developer communities and the industry. And the enthusiasm to continue the efforts of Test The Web Forward event next year in China is under discussion and more local industry volunteers to participate and contribute.</p>
