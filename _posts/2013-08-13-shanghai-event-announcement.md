Test the Web Forward is returning to China this weekend, stopping in Shanghai on August 17-18.

Adobe has partnered with Baidu in planning this event and they've lined up dozens of qualified experts and speakers to educate and support the attendees. The event will kick off with a Welcome and Introduction from Alex Zheng, VP at Baidu, followed by presentations from the W3C HTML Working Group Co-chair, Paul Cotton and Xu Hungbo of Innovation Valley Partners. After the presentations, web developers and experts will work together for two days writing and reviewing W3C tests, and moving the web forward just a little bit more.

We're very happy to welcome the Shanghai web development community into the Test the Web Forward movement!  More details about the event can be found <a href="http://testthewebforward.org/events/shanghai-2013.html">here</a>.
