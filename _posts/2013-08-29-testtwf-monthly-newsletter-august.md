 With one big event finished and another one already in the works, it's 
 been another busy month. We're excited to give you this update and 
 let you know of all the new ways YOU can join the movement and help 
 Make a Better Web.

### Welcome New Subscribers!

 First, a very warm welcome to all of our new subscribers from 
 Shanghai! We're happy to have you join our ever-growing Test the Web 
 Forward community and we're blown away by the fantastic success
 of your event.

### Upcoming TestTWF Events

#### Sacramento HTML5 Meetup: September 17, 7PM PDT

 Due to a last minute cancellation last month, we've rescheduled the
 Sacto meetup for September 17, extending your opportunity to come meet
 some of the TestTWF team and learn more about it. We'll be co-presenting
 with Julee Burdekin of [WebPlatform.org][1], who'll be letting you know
 how you can also contribute to web platform docs. 
 RSVP on [Meetup.com][2].

#### Test the Web Forward @ TPAC, Shenzhen, China: November 9, 9AM-7PM CST

 Now that we've wrapped up the Shanghai event, we've kicked off the
 planning for our next event. Because we love China so much, we're
 heading back! This time we'll be in Shenzhen and for the first time,
 Test the Web Forward will be part of of the W3C's annual [TPAC 
 conference][3]. If you're a W3C working group member planning to be at
 TPAC and you'd like to come and offer your expertise on your favorite
 spec, please let us know! Contact Rebecca Hauck at rhauck @adobe.com. 
 If you're unable to attend TPAC but would like suggest specs or areas
 that need tests, we'd also love your input. You can contact Rebecca
 directly or if you'd like to start a group discussion, please use our 
 new TestTWF event planning mailing list - see more info on this new 
 list below.

### Past TestTWF Events

#### Test the Web Forward Shanghai Roundup

#### Adobe TechLive Webinar

 If you're still curious about what Test the Web Forward is and wer
 unable to join us earlier this month for the Adobe TechLive webinar,
 watch and listen to the recording on [YouTube][11] to learn the history,
 the goals, and the progress of the movement.

### New TestTWF Mailing List
 
 We're pulling back the curtain a little on our event planning process
 and we're inviting all of you to participate. We've created a new public 
 mailing list for this purpose: [public-testtwf-planning@w3.org][12]. If 
 you have ideas for events (especially to suggest areas or specs that
 really need tests) or have questions about running your own, use this list to reach out.

### Get Involved

#### Host your own Test the Web Forward event!

 If you're a community leader, part of a web-related user group, or 
 belong to an organization that wants to Make the Web a Better Place, 
 consider hosting an event of your own or partnering with others in your 
 area to put one on. If you'd like to have a small meetup-style event or 
 we can point you in the right direction. A [Meetup Kit][13] is available 
 and you can contact Susan Parini at parini @adobe.com to get you 
 started.

 For assistance in planning larger events like the one we just had in   
 Shanghai, we'll be rolling out a full Event Kit very soon. If you're
 interested in hosting, partnering, sponsoring, or participating in a 
 future event, let us know at public-testtwf-planning@w3.org.


Let's keep Making the Web a Better Place!
