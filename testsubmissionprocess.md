# Test Submission Process

The way to contribute is just the usual GitHub way: 

* Fork the [GitHub repository][1] (and make sure you're still relatively in
sync with it if you forked a while ago) 

* Create a branch for your changes, `git checkout -b submission/your-name`

* Make your changes

* Push that to your GitHub repository

* Send in a pull request based on the above

Please refer to our [Github 101][2] for guideline details.

You might get asked about completing [W3C's license grant form][3] if your
employer is not already a member and you have not done so before. Someone
will review your test and you might have to do some changes based on that
review. 

You are very welcome to use our [communication channels][4] for any question
and / or issue, such as explicitly asking for review, discuss or announce
your submission.

GitHub itself has a nice long help document explaining [how to contribute to
projects][5].

If you are brand new to Git and GitHub, you should probably read the [getting
started guide][6] from the start. It's nice and friendly. The GitHub [help
pages][7] has lots of other great information and guides.
