# Test Submission Process

The way to contribute is just the usual GitHub way: 

* Fork the [GitHub repository][repo] (and make sure you're still relatively in
sync with it if you forked a while ago) 

* Create a branch for your changes. Being a key of effective Git flow, it is
strongly recommended that the **topic branch** tradition be followed here,
i.e. the branch naming convention is based on the "topic" you will be working
on, e.g. `git checkout -b username/topic-name`

* Make your changes

* Push that to your GitHub repository

* Send in a pull request based on the above

For detailed guidelines on setup and each of these steps, please refer to the [Github Test Submission][github101] documentation.

You are very welcome to use our [communication channels][channels] for any questions
or issues. However, when you submit your pull request, test coordinators and 
reviewers will be notified automatically.
