  TODO This needs to describe the new process explained here:

The test suite is licensed under both the [W3C Test Suite License][1] and the
[3-Clause BSD License][2].

In order to give W3C the permission to distribute your contribution under
these two licenses, you need to complete [W3C's License Grant Form][3],
unless you or your company is a member of the W3C in which case you are
covered already.
