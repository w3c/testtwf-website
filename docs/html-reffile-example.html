    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>This test validates the dir attribute of the bdo element.</p>
    <p>The spec states:</p>
    <blockquote>
    "If the element's dir attribute is in the rtl state,
     then for the purposes of the bidirectional algorithm, the user 
     agent must act as if there was a U+202D LEFT-TO-RIGHT OVERRIDE 
     character at the start of the element, and a U+202C POP 
     DIRECTIONAL FORMATTING at the end of the element."
     </blockquote>
     <p>This reftest verifies that the dir attribute behaves 
        correctly given an "rtl" value.</p>
     <p>A reftest is necessary because the intended effect is purely
     visual.</p>
     <p>This reftest passes if you see WAS displayed below.</p>
