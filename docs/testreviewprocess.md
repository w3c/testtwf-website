# Test Review and Approval Process

The general workflow for test reviews and approval follows the GitHub
contribution model and is summarized here: 

* Pre-condition: we assume everyone that is interested in reviewing and/or
approving W3C's tests will set a "Watch" at GitHub so they will be notified
when a Pull Request (PR) is made. 

* To initiate a review, make a Pull Request to the main `web-platform-
tests/master` on GitHub. This will notify all subscribers of the PR. The
review initiator can also notify the group of the PR via the mailing list in
our [communication channels][1]. 

* Reviewers should review the test code and reply accordingly. If no issues
are found, the reviewer should state that so there is a trail a review was
done. 

* After all of the review issues are addressed, the PR will be merged into
the repository. The merge may be done by the spec's Test Facilitator or
someone that is overseeing the test repository.
 
* The merged tests are considered Approved.
