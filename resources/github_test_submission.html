     <div>
         Now that you have Git set up, you can grab the tests. All of the test repositories are read-only, which means
         you must fork your own copy. This will enable you to submit your tests using a pull request 
         (more on this below).
         <ol>
             <li>In the browser, go the the github page for the test repository:<br />
                 <blockquote>
                     HTML5: <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests"
                               target="top">https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests</a>
                 </blockquote>
                 <blockquote>
                     CSS: <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-test" 
                             target="top">https://github.com/w3c/csswg-test</a>
                 </blockquote>
             </li>
             <li>Click the <img src="../assets/forkbtn.png" align="middle"> button in the upper right</li>
             <li>
                 The fork will take several seconds, then you will be redirected to your github page for this forked
                 repository. If you forked the HTML test repo (for example), you will now be at
                 <b>https://github.com/yourusername/web-platform-tests</b>. 
             </li>
             <li>
                 Once you've successfully forked the repository, you can now clone it (download the files) to your local
                 machine. Go back to your Terminal (Mac) or Git Bash (Windows) and cd into the directory where you want
                 to keep the tests</li>
             </li>
             <li>
                 If you forked the HTML tests: <br />
                 <code>$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-platform-tests.git</code><br /><br />
                 
                 If you forked the CSS tests: <br />
                 <code>$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/csswg-test.git</code><br /><br />
                 
                <i>This will download the tests into a directory named for the repo: /web-platform-tests,
                    /csswg-test</i>
             </li>
             <li>You should now have a full copy of the test repository on your local machine. Feel free to browse the directories on your hard drive. You can also browse them on the github.com page and see the full history of contributions there.</li>
             <li>Next, you'll need to create <a href="#branch">branch</a>.</li>
         </ol>
      </div>
      <h2 class="hed" id="branch">Branch</h2>
       <div>
           <p>Now that you have everything locally, create a branch for your tests. In Terminal (Mac) or 
                   Git Bash (Windows):
            </p>
                <blockquote>
                   <code>$ git checkout -b submissions/yourusername</code><br />
                   <i>This will create a branch named</i> <code>submissions/yourusername</code> <i> and 
                      immediately switch this to be your active working branch</i>
                </blockquote>
                 <p>You're ready to start writing tests! Come back to this page you're ready to <a href="#commit">commit</a> them or <a href="#submit">submit</a> them for review.</p>
       </div>
       <h2 class="hed" id="commit">Commit</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Before you submit your tests for review and contribution to the main test repo, you'll need
                to first commit them locally, where you now have your own personal version control system with
                git. In fact, as you are writing your tests, you may want to save versions of your work as you 
                go before you submit them to be reviewed and merged.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>When you're ready to save a version of your work, go to the Terminal (Mac) or Git Bash (Windows)
                    and cd to the directory where your files are.</li>
                <li>First, ask git what new or modified files you have:<br />
                    <code>$ git status </code><br />
                    <i>This will show you all the differences between your local repo and the original clone it or 
                       since your last local commit</i>
                </li>
                <li>For all new or modified files, you need to tell git to add them to the list of things you'd like
                    to commit:<br />
                    <code>$ git add [file1] [file2] ... [fileN] </code><br/>
                    Or: <br/>
                    <code>$ git add [directory_of_files]</code><br/>
                </li>
                <li>Run <code>git status</code> again to see what you have on the 'Changes to be committed' list.
                    These files are now 'staged'.</li>
                <li>Once you've added everything, you can commit and add a message to this set of changes:<br />
                    <code>$ git commit -m "new test files from TestTWF" </code>
                </li>
                <li>Repeat these steps as many times as you'd like before you submit and definitely do this one 
                    last time before you do.
                </li>
            </ol>
         </div>
      <h2 class="hed" id="submit">Submit</h2>
      <div>
          <p>If you're here now looking for more instructions, that means you've written some awesome tests and 
              are ready to submit them. Congratulations and Welcome Back!
           </p>
          <ol>
              <li>The first thing you do before submitting them to the W3C repo is to push them back up to the 
                  server. <br/>In Terminal (Mac) or Git Bash (Windows): <br />
                  <code>$ git push https://github.com/yourusername/repo-name.git submissions/yourusername</code><br />
                  <br />Or, for short: <br />
                  <code>$ git push origin submissions/yourusername</code><br />
                  <i>Note: Here,</i> <code>origin</code> <i>refers to remote repo from which you cloned
                     (downloaded) the files after you forked, referred to as repo-name.git in the previous
                     example; </i><code>submissions/yourusername</code> 
                     <i>refers to the name of your local branch that you want to push.</i>
              </li>
              <li>Now you can send a message that you have changes or additions you'd like to be reviewed and
                  merged into the main (original) test repository. You do this by using a pull request.  In a browser,
                  open the github page for your forked repository,
                  <b>https://github.com/yourusername/test-repo</b>  
              </li>
              <li>Click the <img src="../assets/pullrequestbtn.png" align="middle"> button.</li>
              <li>On the left, you should see the base repo is the w3c/test-repo. On the right, you should see your
                  fork of that repo. In the branch menu of your forked repo, switch to submissions/yourusername
              </li>
              <li>In the Title field, enter a brief description for your submission.  Example: Tests for CSS Transforms
                  skew() function.
              </li>
              <li>If you'd like to add more detailed comments, use the comment field below</li>
              <li>Click <img src="../assets/sendpullrequest.png" align="middle">
          </ol>
          <p>That's it! If you're currently at a Test the Web Forward event, find an expert nearby and ask for a review.
             If you're doing this on your own (AWESOME!), your pull request will be go into a queue and will be reviewed
             soon. Feel free to email appropriate test suite mailing list and ask for a review.

               <li>Once you have added your files for the first time with <code>git add [file]</code>, you dont need 
                   to run <code>git add</code> + <code>git commit</code> for all subsequent commits. Instead, you 
                   can pass the <code>-a</code> flag when you commit:<br />
                   <code>$ git commit -a -m "saving a version of my test"</code>

               <li>If you'd like to maintain a master branch in git, you can merge your work from <code>

                    <code>$ git checkout master </code><br />
                    <i>This will make master your active working branch</i><br />
