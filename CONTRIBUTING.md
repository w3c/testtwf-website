## Build tool

This website is currently built using [GitHub Pages][gh-pages] which itself
relies on [Jekyll][jekyll]. This automatically transforms the content of this
repository into a [static website hosted on GitHub][github-io]. We now have a
[temporary domain][staging] pointing to it.

### Running Jekyll locally

[Installing Jekyll][install-jekyll] is easy. You'll also need the
[Redcarpet markdown parser][redcarpet] which is available as a Ruby gem:

    $ sudo gem install redcarpet

Once installed, launch Jekyll from the command line:

    $ jekyll --server --auto

and navigate your browser to `http://localhost:4000`. Modifications to the
source code get automatically picked-up and displayed on page refresh.

## Documentation format

Documentation should be written using [Markdown][markdown]. It will be
transformed into HTML during the build process.

To ease online review, lines should be no longer than 80 characters. This is
greatly simplified by using [reference style links][ref-style] placed at the
bottom of the page. For example (lifted off John Gruber's
[Markdown Syntax guide][markdown]):

    This is [an example][eg] reference-style link.
    
    [...]
    
    Then, anywhere in the document (usually at the end), you define your link
    label like this, on a line by itself:
    
    [eg]: http://example.com/

Favor named referenced over indexed ones, as those make refactoring much
simpler.

As an added benefit, this syntax makes keeping links up to date a
lot easier as they are all placed together at the bottom of the page.

## Blog post format

Blog post should be written using either HTML or [Markdown][markdown]. In Jekyll,
blog posts are just regular text files which get treated differently when
following a few simple conventions (mainly file names and directory structure)
as described in the [online documentation][jekyll-blog].

All blog posts must be located in the `_posts` directory.

Blog posts can use two different kinds of templates depending on the depth of the
article. Regular, in depth posts should use the `post` template (by specifying it
in the [YAML front-matter][front-matter]). Shorter, quick posts can use the
`quickpost` template. While the former pulls data from the experts database
located in the [site-wide config file][config] in order to populate the "about the
author section", the former doesn't.

Also noteworthy is the ability to signal when posts have been cross-posted elsewhere.
This can be done using the `x-post` property in the [YAML front-matter][front-matter].

## Event page format

Event pages should be written in HTML. A lot of the content is automatically
generated from data placed in the [YAML front-matter][front-matter]. This
includes:

* name of the venue (`venue`, and `localized_venue` fields),
* date of the event (`date`, and `localized_date` fields),
* title of the page (optional `title` field),
* list of event sponsors (`sponsors` field),
* list of event speakers (`speakers` field), and
* list of event experts (`experts` field).

Setting the language of the page (`lang` field) can help automatically
localize some of the above.

There are good examples of how to author this YAML front-matter in the
[page for the Seattle event][event-eg].

The `sponsors`, `speakers` and `experts` field simply pull data out of the
[site-wide config file][config] (a poor man's db) which they run through
[templates][templates] to produce markup. So for example:

``` yaml
---
lang: zho
speakers: [Rebecca Hauck]
---
```

will automatically create the following HTML markup:

``` html
<div class="block-speakers">
  <h2 id="speakers" class="hed">专家</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <img width="48" height="48" src="/assets/experts/rhauck.jpg" alt=''>
       <h4>Rebecca Hauck</h4>
       <p>Adobe, CSS Working Group</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

Note that while sponsors get automatically added to the end of the events page,
speakers and experts need to be included via an `include tag` at the desired
location. E.g.:

``` html
<p>Some content goes here:</p>

{% include speakers.html %}

<p>All talks will be given in English.</p>

{% include experts.html %}
```

Should you need to modify or add a speaker, expert or sponsor, please do so in
the [config file][config]. The format is [YAML][yaml] of which JSON is a
subset. Note that speakers and experts share the same `experts` entry.

## File names

File names should be lowercased, hyphenated and use the `.md` extension for
[Markdown](markdown)-formated content (e.g.: `review-process.md`). The build
step will change these to `review-process.html` and use it as URL.

## Contribution workflow

Contributions should follow the standard open source GitHub workflow (fork
the repository, work off topic-branches, send atomic commits as pull requests,
and get them reviewed by a peer).

Generally, contributing to a doc will imply:

1.  commenting on the issue to announce you're planning to work on it,
2.  looking at [existing docs][resources] to find related content,
3.  using an [online service][fuckyeahmarkdown] to convert that content to
    [Markdown][markdown],
4.  copyediting it,
5.  adding [YAML front-matter][front-matter], and
6.  sending a pull request.
