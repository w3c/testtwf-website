<p>One of the intentions of the <a href="http://movethewebforward.org">Move the web forward</a> initiative is to get you more involved in contributing to the web platform you help define. We've organized a number of hackathons that will help you get there and more are being planned! Representatives from W3C, Google, Mozilla, Microsoft, Opera, and Adobe will be on hand to guide you.</p>

<p>During these hackathons, you will discover new web features and learn how to write tests that will help browsers make implementations of these features consistent.</p>

<p>Experts will be on hand to help you write tests for W3C specifications in several areas as well as guide you through filing bug reports. You will learn new web features and recommended practices that will be useful in projects you contribute to in the future!</p>
