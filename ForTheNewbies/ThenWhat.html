    <h1>Then What? Test Review Process</h1>

    <p>When a pull request is created, your tests are now pending approval.</p>
    <p>Various members of the W3C HTML Testing Task Force will attempt to find the time to do a code review.</p>
    <p>By default, your tests will not be edited by anyone else. You will be the one who needs to address any comments or questions that are raised before the tests are approved.</p>
    <p>Once the Task Force is satisfied with the quality of the tests, your pull request branch will be merged into the W3C repository master and/or CR branch(es). This means that they were approved!</p>
    <p>This review is currently a rather slow and ad-hoc process, but the more tests submitted, the more efficient this part will have to get!</p>
