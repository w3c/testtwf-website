    <h1>Submitting Tests</h1>

    <h2>First, Check Your Tests</h2>

    <p>Make a localhost for your personal testfile directory (open terminal, change to the necessary directory using <kbd>cd ~/path</kbd>, then type <kbd>httpserver<kbd>).</p>

    <p>Use as many browsers as possible to check your results before submitting your tests. This helps you to catch use cases that may not have been obvious on one browser, and it also might give you a “heads-up” to pass along to the spec editors about how the real world behaves in comparison to their expectations.</p>

    <span class="todo"><p>If you do come across such a “heads up” situation, <a href="../ForTheNewbies.html#spec_bugs" target="_blank">file a bug on that spec</a> to let the editor know.</p></span>

    <h2>Submit a New Batch of Tests</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>on your local drive, <kbd>cd</kbd> into <kbd>html-testsuite</kbd>.
        <li>make sure you're up to date:
<p>run <kbd>git status</kbd> to make sure the working directory is clean.</p>
<p>type <kbd>git fetch origin</kbd>.</p>
<p>type <kbd>git merge origin/master</kbd>.</p>
<p>then, update your fork by typing <kbd>git push &lt;your_forkname&gt; master</kbd></p>
        </li>
        <li>create a branch for your submission: <kbd>git checkout -b &lt;your_branchname&gt;</kbd> <em>(Note: your branchname is a combination of three things: <b>“submission/”</b> + <b>your name</b> + “-” + <b>test type</b>. For example, if James Bond wrote some tests about links, he would create the branch <b>submission/jamesbond-links</b>.)</em></li>
        <li>add your tests into the testsuite structure <em>(You can just copy and paste your test files from your own testing area into the right directories within the testsuite repository. If you are not sure which is the “right directory”, <a href="https://github.com/w3c/html-testsuite/tree/master/tools/scripts/id2path.json" target="_blank">this file</a> provides a mapping from the spec section's ID attribute to that section's place in the repository's directory structure.)</em></li>
        <li>type <kbd>git add .</kbd> to add all the files.</li>
        <li>type <kbd>git commit</kbd> to commit the files <em>(first line of message is a simple imperative, next paragraph can go into more detail)</em></li>
        <li>push the tests to your remote: type <kbd>git push &lt;your_forkname&gt; &lt;your_branchname&gt;</li>
        <li>up on GitHub, in your forked repository, initiate a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests" target="_blank">pull request</a> on that new branch.</li>
        <li>You're done for now! Now you await comments and see if the tests get approved. :-)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Submit Updates to an Existing Pull Request</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>in your local terminal, in the <kbd>html-testsuite</kbd> folder, switch to the branch you used for that submission: <kbd>git checkout -b &lt;your_branchname&gt;</li>
        <li>if your local file copies have been deleted in meantime thanks to <code>master branch</code> updates, pull back from remote so that you have the server's version of your current pull request: <kbd>git pull &lt;your_forkname&gt; &lt;your_branchname&gt;</li>
        <li>copy the updated files from your own testing area into the tree structure</li>
        <li>type <kbd>git status</kbd>, <kbd>git add</kbd>, <kbd>git diff --cached</kbd>, <kbd>git diff --check</kbd> (for white space) as much as you like</li>
        <li>when all looks well, type <kbd>git commit</kbd> <em>(first line of message is a simple imperative, next paragraph can go into more detail)</em></li>
        <li>type <kbd>git push &lt;your_forkname&gt; &lt;your_branchname&gt;</li>
        <li>Phew! Maybe this time the branch will be approved.</li>
    </ol>
