        <h2 id="github">A GitHub account, along with our testsuite-so-far</h2>

        <p>W3C uses GitHub to receive submissions and to host the complete testsuite, so please <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">join GitHub</a> if you haven't already.</p>

        <p>Then, get the testsuite:
            <ul>
                <li>in your local terminal, <kbd>cd</kbd> into the directory in which you want to put our <kbd>html-testsuite</kbd> structure</li>
<li>type <kbd>git clone git@github.com:w3c/html-testsuite.git</kbd></li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Go ahead and fork it, so that you'll be ready to submit tests:</p>
<ul>
                <li>up in GitHub, on the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/html-testsuite" target="_blank">source page</a>, choose <b>fork</b>, choose <b>SSH</b>, and copy the URL.</li>
<li>back in your local terminal, type <kbd>git add remote &lt;your_forkname&gt; &lt;URL&gt;</kbd></li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2 id="js">Some JavaScript Files</h2>

        <p>Thanks to James Graham, there is a great API to help you write robust tests and automatically assemble the pass/fail results. Please:
        <ul>
            <li>download the <kbd><a href="https://github.com/w3c/testharness.js/blob/master/testharness.js">testharness.js</a></kbd> and <kbd><a href="https://github.com/w3c/testharness.js/blob/master/testharnessreport.js">testharness-report.js</a></kbd> files from their own GitHub repository.</li>
            <li>save these files into a <kbd>resources</kbd> folder within whichever local directory you will use for writing your own tests</li>
        </ul>
